# GameClock

Time your chess games, jenga games, and other board games.

## Developing

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Once the modules are installed, just run a web server. Thanks to
[@pika/web](https://github.com/pikapkg/web), no build step is needed to test the
program.

To generate the Service Worker, run `npm run sw`.
